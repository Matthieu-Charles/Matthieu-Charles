Hi everyone, 
I'm Matthieu, a french developper. I have always been into computer, but took another path for the past few years. Until last year! In february 2022, I decided to become a developper! From this day, I have learned about the "usuals suspects" (Html, Css, JavaScript and frameworks associated, => Bootstrap, React, Angular) and back-end too (Php and Symfony). I dont have yet a lot of projects to display, but I intend it to change soon!
Until then, have fun on my Github, and feel free to contact me for projects!
